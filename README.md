# tf2classic-issue-tracker
This repository exists solely for reporting bugs in Team Fortress 2 Classic. It is NOT for technical support.

Before reporting an issue, ensure it hasn't already been reported, and then thoroughly document it with all of the information you have regarding your setup, what caused it, what you suspect the issue might be, etc.

Issues should be easily reproducible, and clearly the fault of the game. If you're having personal issues regarding the game, check the [Troubleshooting page](https://wiki.tf2classic.com/wiki/Troubleshooting) and/or ask in the #technical-issues channel of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3zMk4vn).
